# BudgetTracker

This app is intended to allow the user to keep track of his/her budget even when not connected to Internet as PWA.

Technologies used: Node.js, JavaScript, Express.js, Mongoose, Chart.js

Current issues: Does not have the code needed for IndexedDB and MongoDB to communicate to transfer offline transactions once the user becomes connected.  Will update once I know how to complete.  Directed by instructor and TA to turn in as is.  Interface will work locally on Port 3000.
